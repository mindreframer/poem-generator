[cliche]
as the skies clear
as I lie dying
in the frozen wastes
beyond good and evil
like a bleeding vampire
in the end
thinking about it now
looking back
at the darkest hour
just as I had thought
exactly as I had known
in the darkest night
beyond the borders of sanity
in a padded cell
another victim of tyranny
as my tears flow
among the mindless crowds
the truth is
in endless darkness
beyond time and space
beyond thought and memory
"Save us from ourselves!"
the pain is too great to bear
